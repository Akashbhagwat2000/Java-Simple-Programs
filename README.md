4. Factorial of a Number:
   Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number and display the result.

5. Fibonacci Series:
   Write a program to generate and display the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms.

6. Check Prime Number:
   Write a program to check whether a given number is prime or not and display the result.

7. Reverse a Number:
   Write a program to reverse a given number and display the reversed number.

8. Swap Two Numbers:

9. Calculate Average of Numbers:
   Write a program to calculate the average of a given set of numbers and display the result.

10. Check Leap Year:
    Write a program to check whether a given year is a leap year or not and display the result.

11. Pattern: Right Triangle
	*
	**
	***
	****
	*****

    Write a Java program to print a right triangle pattern using asterisks (*). The number of rows in the triangle should be taken as input from the user. Each row should have a number of asterisks equal to the row number.

12.Pattern: Pyramid
	    *
	   ***
	  *****
	 *******
	*********

   Write a Java program to print a pyramid pattern using asterisks (*). The number of rows in the pyramid should be taken as input from the user. Each row should have a number of asterisks equal to twice the row number minus one. The pyramid should be centered.

13.Pattern: Diamond
	    *
	   ***
	  *****
	 *******
	*********
	 *******
	  *****
	   ***
	    *

   Write a Java program to print a diamond pattern using asterisks (*). The number of rows in the diamond should be taken as input from the user. The top half of the diamond should follow the pyramid pattern, and the bottom half should be the reverse of the top half.

14.Pattern: Number Triangle
	1
	22
	333
	4444
	55555

   Write a Java program to print a number triangle pattern. The number of rows in the triangle should be taken as input from the user. Each row should have a number of digits equal to the row number, and each digit should be the row number itself.

15.Armstrong Number:
   Write a Java program to check if a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.

   Your program should take an integer as input from the user and determine whether it is an Armstrong number or not. Display an appropriate message indicating the result.

17.Palindrome Number:
   Write a Java program to check if a given number is a palindrome or not. A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example, 121 is a palindrome number because it reads the same from left to right and right to left.

   Your program should take an integer as input from the user and determine whether it is a palindrome number or not. Display an appropriate message indicating the result.
